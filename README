== Requirements ==

UserProfiles requires the RecordRelations plugin.

== Usage ==

UserProfiles allows administrators to define different profile types. For example, you could create a "Basics" profile
type for name and location, and a separate "Education" profile type for educational background. You can (and should)
also give a description for the profile type. Within each type,
you define the fields you want to use by giving them a name, a description, and a field type (short text, long text, 
single checkbox, multiple checkbox, radio buttons, or dropdown). For the non-text, also provide the
valid values.

The default public display of a public profile also shows the recently added items for the user, if any.

== Using UserProfiles Elsewhere in Omeka ==

UserProfiles provides a handful of helper functions to help you relate users to other content in your site, for example
by adding a link to the user who created an Item to the user profile.
